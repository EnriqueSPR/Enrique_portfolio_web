      <description>Description: An end-to-end project in data is scraped , cleaned, and analysed to find a model able to accurately predict second hard prices cars in Spain.
This is a great tool to have if you are looking for a second car or if you want to sell yours.
Code and Resources Used: Python Version: 3.7
Packages: pandas, numpy, datetime, re, requests, csv, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, pickle and json.

      <description>Description: I will be using a dataset containing information from a bicycle rental company called capital bikeshare located in Washington D.C founded in 2010. The aim is to use the data from the past 10 years (2010-2020) to develop a model that can predict bicycle usage (Number of trips and total time ride usage) at a given day.
Code and Resources Used: Python Version: 3.7
Packages: pandas, numpy, datetime, os, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly.</description>

      <guid>https://enriquespr.github.io/Enrique_portfolio_web/post/project_3/</guid>
      <description>Description: In this project we will tackle a multi-classification problem using supervised ML on a well-known dataset containing red wine quality parameters. Find the dataset here. This dataset contains quality parameters for 1596 red-wines, which we can use to build a model that predicts red wine quality.
Code and Resources Used Python Version: 3.7
Packages: pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, random.

1. Data cleaning and feature engineering:   Handled Nan values:
 Columns with more than 40 % nan values were directly removed. For categorical variables nan values were filled with &amp;ldquo;Unknown&amp;rdquo; For numerical variables nans were filled with the median, after visualy recognizing the presence of outliers using boxplots.</description>

      <description>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and has resulted in an ongoing pandemic. As of 15 August 2020, more than 21.1 million cases have been reported across 188 countries and territories, resulting in more than 765,000 deaths. More than 13.2 million people have recovered. The spread of this virus is currently accelerating globaly; hence it is important to better understand its behaviour-spread.</description>

      <description>Summary:   I scrapped the data from ATP tournaments, matches and players from 1999 to 2020 (&amp;gt; 78000 matches).
  I performed data cleaning steps and feature engineering to create information of the players form at the moment of the upcoming match.
  Exploratory data analyses were carried out to get insight into the features correlation and distribution. This allowed to select the most relevant features for the model.</description>

      <description>Summary:   Scraped over 2000 house rent information from https://www.pisos.com/ using python and the beautifulsoup library.
  Performed data cleaning steps and removed outliers.
  Exploratory Data Analyses shed light into the most important parameters driving house prices in Spain. These parameters were chosen in the model building process.
  Optimized Linear, Lasso, Decission Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Regressors using GridsearchCV to find the best model.</description>

      <description>Summary:   Created a tool that estimates data science salaries to help data scientists negotiate their income when they get a job.
  Scraped over 1000 job descriptions from glassdoor using python and selenium.
  Engineered features from the text of each job description to quantify the value companies put on python, excel, aws, and spark.
  Optimized Linear, Lasso, and Random Forest Regressors using GridsearchCV to reach the best model.</description>
