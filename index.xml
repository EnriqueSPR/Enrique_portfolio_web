      <description>Description: I will be using a dataset containing information from a bicycle rental company called capital bikeshare located in Washington D.C founded in 2010. The aim is to use the data from the past 10 years (2010-2020) to develop a model that can predict bicycle usage (Number of trips and total time ride usage) at a given day.

      <description>Description: In this project we will tackle a multi-classification problem using supervised ML on a well-known dataset containing red wine quality parameters. Find the dataset here. This dataset contains quality parameters for 1596 red-wines, which we can use to build a model that predicts red wine quality. Following analyses of feature distribution and data preprocessing, several classification models were trained and their performance assessed. Three models (SVC, RFC and ETC) were chosed, tuned and ensembled using sorf voting classifier 🍷⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</description>

      <description>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and has resulted in an ongoing pandemic. As of 15 August 2020, more than 21.1 million cases have been reported across 188 countries and territories, resulting in more than 765,000 deaths. More than 13.2 million people have recovered. The spread of this virus is currently accelerating globaly; hence it is important to better understand its behaviour-spread.</description>

      <description>Summary 🥎🎾🏆:   I scrapped the data from ATP tournaments, matches and players from 1999 to 2020 (&amp;gt; 78000 matches).
  I performed data cleaning steps and feature engineering to create information of the players form at the moment of the upcoming match.
  Exploratory data analyses were carried out to get insight into the features correlation and distribution. This allowed to select the most relevant features for the model.</description>

      <description>Summary:   Scraped over 2000 house rent information from https://www.pisos.com/ using python and the beautifulsoup library.
  Performed data cleaning steps and removed outliers.
  Exploratory Data Analyses shed light into the most important parameters driving house prices in Spain. These parameters were chosen in the model building process.
  Optimized Linear, Decission Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Regressors using GridsearchCV to find the best model 💲💲🏚🏠💲⛪💲.</description>

      <description>Summary:   Created a tool that estimates data science salaries to help data scientists negotiate their income when they get a job.
  Scraped over 1000 job descriptions from glassdoor using python and selenium.
  Engineered features from the text of each job description to quantify the value companies put on python, excel, aws, and spark.
  Optimized Linear, Lasso, and Random Forest Regressors using GridsearchCV to reach the best model 💲📊👀</description>

      <description>Description 🔬🧬🧫🌱🌾: Firstly, I exemplify all the steps involved in the data analysis process with a simple experiment that I carried out during my PhD. Secondly, I discuss how I summarized 300Gb of Complex Biological Data (proteomics) into to a Single Figure, which I believe comes to show the importance of data analytic tools and statistics. The power of such tools becomes even more apparent on complex data.

      <description>Description 🔬🧬🧫🌱🌾: The goal of this project was to better understand the role of a set of tomato pathogenic related genes (PR genes) agaist a economically devastating fungus (B.cinerea).
Two main aspects of these genes were studied:
1. PR gene expression level by q-RT-PCR: During this experiment, we analized the constitutive expression level of the PR genes in different tomato plant parts (Figure 1). In order to do so, plant samples were immediately snap-frozen and crushed in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C.</description>
